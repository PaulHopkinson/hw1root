				<td><h3>Diversity</h3>
					<br>At the very core of our excellence is our longstanding commitment to build and nurture a campus community characterized by a diversity of people, heritage, academic disciplines and scholarly pursuits.  We know that a broad spectrum of perspectives leads to richer educational experiences and intellectual engagement for everyone. Our many and varied voices must all be heard and equally valued. They help us challenge one anotherâ€™s preconceived notions and expand our understanding. The fabric of our community is simply more vibrant when it is a diverse one.</td>

				<td><h3>Integrity</h3>
					<br>Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else's work (including, but not limited to a published article, a book, a website, computer code, or a paper from a friend) without clear attribution. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work, which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be. Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. </td>
